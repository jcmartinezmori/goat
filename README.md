Source code for "Who's the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data-driven Random Walks on the Symmetric Group," by Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia and J. Carlos Mart√≠nez Mori, arXiv 2409.12107, 2024.

The main execution file is main.py, which invokes:
  - helper.py, which pre-processes publicly available data compiled by GitHub user JeffSackmann
  - walker.py, which executes the data-driven random walk

The post-processing files are:
  - poset.py, which uses the output of main.py to build a poset
  - hasse.py, which uses the output of poset.py to prepare a Hasse diagram
  - extension.py, which uses the output of poset.py to prepare linear extensions and a figure of average ranks
  - scatter.py, which uses the output of extension.py to prepare a matrix of scatter plots of average ranks
