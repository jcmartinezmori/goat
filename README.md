This repository contains the source code for manuscript "Who's the GOAT? Sports Rankings and Data-driven Random Walks on the Symmetric Group," by Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia and J. Carlos Mart√≠nez Mori, arXiv 2409.12107, 2024.

The main execution file is main.py, which invokes:
  - helper.py, which pre-processes publicly available data compiled by GitHub user JeffSackmann; and
  - walker.py, which executes the data-driven random walk.

The post-processing files are:
  - poset.py, which uses the output of main.py to build a poset;
  - hasse.py, which uses the output of poset.py to prepare a Hasse diagram;
  - extension.py, which uses the output of poset.py to prepare linear extensions and a figure of average ranks; and
  - scatter.py, which uses the output of extension.py to prepare a matrix of scatter plots of average ranks at different cutoffs.

This code requires SageMath. The directories contain all figures and (almost) all outputs, with the exception of those the ATP at cutoff 20 (which can be reproduced using the source code, but was too heavy to make available here directly).
